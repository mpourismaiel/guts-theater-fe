# Guts theater client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the project and creates the `build/` directory. You can run the project
using a configurable web server that allows redirects from all paths to `build/index.html`

## Ease of access

Please make use of the Dockerfile provided in this repository to easily run the project.

Also, please visit [guts-theater](https://github.com/mpourismaiel/guts-theater) for the API, since without that project, this application would not function properly.
